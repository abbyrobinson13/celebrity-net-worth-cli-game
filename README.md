# celebrity-net-worth-cli-game

To start the game open two terminals run:
First server run - $ node server.js
Second server run - $ node index.js

Rules of the game: 2 celebrities will randomly be selected. The user will get to pick between A or B of who they think has a higher net worth. After 10 correct answers you will get to pick between 3 celebrities. The server keeps track of your high score for you.

Good luck and have fun!
